The guessing game program is designed to generate a random number and challenge the user to guess it correctly. Here's how the program works:

Generating a Random Number:

The program starts by generating a random number. This number remains constant throughout the game session.
User Input and Comparison:

The program prompts the user to input their guess for the random number.
It compares the user's guess with the randomly generated number.
Providing Feedback:

If the user's guess is correct, the program congratulates the user and displays the number of attempts it took to win the game.
If the guess is too high, the program informs the user that their guess is too high and prompts them to guess again.
If the guess is too low, the program informs the user that their guess is too low and prompts them to guess again.
Looping Until Correct Guess:

The program continues to prompt the user for guesses until they correctly guess the random number.
Game Completion:

Once the correct number is guessed, the program displays a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts taken to guess correctly.
It then terminates the game.
